        <p>Architected by Todd Wolf</p>

            <h2>Modern Systems Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                Gravity Binary explores modular architectures, scalable automation, and the use of AI as a force multiplier 
                in large and complex engineering environments. The work focuses on structure, clarity, and the ability to 
                transform systems at scale through disciplined design.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Working at Scale</h2>
            <p>
                Much of this project centers on understanding and shaping large codebases, building tools that support 
                transformation, and designing processes that allow a single engineer to operate effectively across 
                significant technical surfaces. The emphasis is on clarity, repeatability, and consequence-aware execution.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>AI and Algorithmic Acceleration</h2>
            <p>
                Gravity Binary incorporates AI-driven analysis and algorithmic structure to support tasks that traditionally 
                require large teams. The goal is not to replace engineering judgment, but to amplify it through 
                well-designed systems and automation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Systems-Level Thinking</h2>
            <p>
                The project reflects a mindset shaped by systems engineering, compiler concepts, and the challenges of 
                maintaining and evolving foundational software. It is built on the belief that modern engineering requires 
                both precision and adaptability.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Engineering Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Gravity Binary is guided by a growth mindset, a willingness to explore bold ideas, and a commitment to 
                building tools that make complex work more manageable. It is an ongoing exploration of how structure, 
                automation, and thoughtful design can reshape the way engineers work.
